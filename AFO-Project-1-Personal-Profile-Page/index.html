      <p> That's me to the left! I'm a proud Afro-Latina and big sister! I like to keep myself busy with STEM studies. It can range from Calculus, programming, or even chemistry in the kitchen. I still like to express myself in the arts. Currently, I'm relearning how to paint in gouche, drawing, fashion, and especially my hair! I love to express myself with my hair, you'll see!</p>

      <p><strong> Women in Stem! </strong> It's so hard to get into any men dominated field, especially the technology industry. Katherine Johnson faced even more barriers in 1969! I refer to one of her famous quotes... </p>
      <p id="Quote"> <a href="https://wearetechwomen.com/inspirational-quotes-katherine-johnson-nasa-mathematician/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20will%20always%20have%20STEM,always%2C%20always%20be%20mathematics.%E2%80%9D">"Girls are capable of doing everything men are capable of doing. Sometimes they have more imagination than men."</a></p>
